## Purpose

`envoy-xds-controller` is a Kubernetes-native control plane component and xDS server designed to dynamically manage the configuration of Envoy proxies based on cluster state and user-defined APIs.

It enables centralized, declarative control of routing, service discovery, and security policies for Envoy without manual editing of configuration files.

## Key Features

- üì° **XDS API (v3) support**:
    - Cluster Discovery Service (CDS)
    - Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS)
    - Listener Discovery Service (LDS)
    - Route Discovery Service (RDS)

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Kubernetes-native integration**:
    - Watches native resources (e.g., Services, Endpoints, ConfigMaps)
    - Uses `controller-runtime` for reconciliation
    - Manages CRDs for custom behavior (if applicable)

- üîê **Authentication & Authorization**:
    - OIDC support via `go-oidc`
    - Role-based access control using Casbin

- üß† **Dynamic configuration updates**:
    - Real-time propagation of routing and cluster changes
    - Declarative configuration via CRDs or API

- üß∞ **Extensible architecture**:
    - Modular design using internal packages for `xds`, `cache`, `updater`
    - gRPC/HTTP API support via Connect RPC
    - Can be embedded into other control planes

## Use Cases

- Managing Envoy configuration in a dynamic microservices environment
- Implementing a custom service mesh control plane
- Enforcing fine-grained access control over xDS data
