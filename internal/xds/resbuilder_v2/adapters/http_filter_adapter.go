	// to the original method's logic. In a real implementation, you would need to either:
	// 1. Modify filters.Builder to expose buildRBACFilter as a public method
	// 2. Re-implement the logic here based on the original method

	if vs.Spec.RBAC == nil {

	// filters.Builder.buildRBACFilter or find a way to call the private method

	// proper implementation in production code
